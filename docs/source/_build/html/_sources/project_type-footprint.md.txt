## Import structure

```json
{
  "inputGeometries" : "https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/f/7a61e549b6/?dl=1",
  "project" : {
    "image" : "http://www.fragosus.com/test/Javita.jpg",
    "lookFor" : "Buildings",
    "name" : "Mapping to end FGM in North Monduli",
    "projectDetails" : "Swipe slowly through the satellite imagery and mark anything that looks like it could be a building or village. This area has high levels of girls being subjected to FGM and child marriage.",
    "verificationCount" : "3"
  },
  "projectType" : 2,
  "tileServer" : "bing"
}
```

The `tileserver` attribute can have the following values: `bing`, `custom`. If a custom tileserver is chosen, you need to provide a `custom_tileserver_url` attribute which links to a TMS using x, y, z placeholders.

Imports which have been imported successfully will have a `complete` attribute set to `true`.
