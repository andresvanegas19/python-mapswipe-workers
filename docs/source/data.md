# Data
Swiping is just the beginning -- MapSwipe data is created by our users and accessible to the entire community. Through the [MapSwipe website](https://mapswipe.org/data.html) you can see where we've mapped, which organizations are requesting data, and how many individuals contribute to our impact. When using MapSwipe data, all you have to do is credit the MapSwipe contributors. Here you find a more detailed description of the data available.

## Aggregated Results
This gives you the unfiltered MapSwipe results. This is most suited if you want to apply some custom data processing with the MapSwipe data, e.g. select only specific tasks for machine learning. If you want to use MapSwipe data in the Tasking Manager you might look for the data described below.

Additionally, project type specific data can be found here. E.g. Validate projects which were created based on OSM data, will have data describing the original OSM object included.

## HOT Tasking Manager Geometries
This gives you filtered MapSwipe data ready to be imported to the HOT Tasking Manager.
Currently, the geometries in this dataset consist of maximum 15 MapSwipe Tasks, where at least 35% of all users indicated the presence of a building by classifying as "yes" or "maybe".
