      "pre": "For this project we are looking for new settlements. Compare the upper (before) and lower (after) image and swipe right to indicate that new settlements have been built.",
      "post_correct": "Yes, that looks like a new settlement being developed, as also suggested by new roads visible in the more recent image. Swipe left to continue the tutorial.",
      "post_wrong": "Oh no. Make sure to spot all the new settlements and swipe right. New roads can also function as an indicator sometimes."

      "pre": "And again: If new settlements have been built, swipe to the right side.",
      "post_correct": "Correct. We can spot new settlements in the upper right part of the satellite image. Swipe left to go on with some more examples.",

    "no_changes_1": {
      "pre": "In this example, no settlements emerged. Swipe left to indicate no changes.",

      "pre": "We can spot changes in the vegetation for this imagery pair, but no changes related to settlements. Again, swipe left.",
      "post_correct": "Cool. You got it. Just look out for changes concerning settlements.",
      "post_wrong": "Sorry, try again. Don't be distracted by changes in vegetation, just look out for settlements."

    "maybe_1": {
      "pre": "Sometimes it might be unclear if settlements emerged. Swipe down if you are not sure.",
      "post_correct": "Great. We cannot really tell if the bright spot in the middle is a new settlement. This is a 'maybe'.",
      "post_wrong": "Are you really sure? Sometimes it's better to mark the imagery as 'not sure'."

      "pre": "Swipe up to indicate if there is no imagery or if there are clouds.",
      "post_correct": "That's right, that image was way too cloudy to make a good assessment! You managed to pass through this tutorial, now it's time for some real mapping.",
      "post_wrong": "It there is no imagery or clouds, we cannot tell the right answer. Make sure to mark this as well by swiping up."
